                <h3>One Piece Game</h3>
                <p>
                    This game is called One Piece. It is a simple adventure game made with UWP (Universal Windows
                    Platform). The player controls Luffy, a character from the anime One Piece. The goal is to collect
                    crew members like Sanji, Zoro, Nami, and Robin while avoiding obstacles like rocks and waves.
                    The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level changes the number of
                    collectibles, obstacles, and the time limit. The game also includes a score system and saves the
                    top 5 high scores in a file. If the player gets a new high score, they can enter their name.

                <h3>Contoso Power Bi</h3>
                <p>
                    This Power BI project analyzes the Contoso Retail Data Warehouse to provide actionable
                    insights for management. The dashboard answers key business questions such as identifying
                    best-selling and underperforming products, determining the most profitable channels, and
                    evaluating profitability trends across years, quarters, and months. The solution includes
                    an optimized data model and interactive visualizations—such as KPIs, bar charts, line charts,
                    and slicers—designed to highlight critical metrics and support data-driven decision-making.
